        <h2 class="title">Snowflake BOT</h2>
        <p class="desc"><img src="/files/snowflake-bot.png" alt="mcbr" class="thumbnail">A Discord bot made
            specifically for The Snowflake Team, out of curiosity. It has some generic
            Discord bot features, but nothing really special. It's open source, but if you want to avoid getting a
            seizure,
            please don't look at the music player's code. You can play rock, paper, scissors with it, so that's
            pretty cool I guess. Use the 'help' command to get a list of all the features.<br>You can check it out if
            you'd like to: <button class="gradient-btn btn-snowflakebot"
                onclick="goto('https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=759152855499800607&permissions=8&scope=bot');">Invite</button><button

        <h2 class="title">Minecraft Battle Royale</h2>
        <p class="desc"><img src="/files/mcbr.png" alt="mcbr" class="thumbnail">A Spigot plugin for 1.16.5 that lets
            you play a game mode (very) similar to UHC, however it
            gives you the liberty of defining a combat arena anywhere and specifying the preparation time for some
            interesting combinations. There can also be multiple matches going on at one time, this plugin can be
            installed very easily on any server. This is my very first plugin and Java project.<br>Get the latest
            version here: <button class="gradient-btn btn-mcbr"
                onclick="goto('/files/mcbr-1.16.5.jar');">Download</button>Type '/mcbr' in-game to get a list of all
            the self-explanatory commands.</p>
